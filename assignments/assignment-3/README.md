# Portfolio Styling Assignment - CSC317 Assignment 3

## Overview
This portfolio demonstrates four different CSS styling approaches:
1. **Hand-written CSS** (`styles/styles.css`)
2. **AI-generated CSS #1** (`styles/ai-1.css`) - Text prompt only
3. **AI-generated CSS #2** (`styles/ai-2.css`) - Image + text prompt
4. **Hybrid Solution** (`styles/hybrid.css`) - Best of all approaches

## How to View Different Styles

To switch between different CSS versions, edit the `<link>` tag in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Uncomment ONE of the following lines: -->

<!-- Hand-written CSS -->
<!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/styles.css"> -->

<!-- AI-generated CSS #1 (Text prompt) -->
<!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/ai-1.css"> -->

<!-- AI-generated CSS #2 (Image + text prompt) -->
<!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/ai-2.css"> -->

<!-- Hybrid Solution (Currently active) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/hybrid.css">
```
