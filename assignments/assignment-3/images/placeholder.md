# Images Directory

This directory contains the image files for the portfolio:

## Current Images:
- ✅ `Profile.JPG` - Professional headshot/profile photo (2.8MB)
- ✅ `SFSU.jpg` - San Francisco State University logo (52KB)

## Optional Additional Images:
- Add any additional project screenshots or portfolio images here as needed

## Image Guidelines:
- ✅ Use web-optimized formats (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics)
- ✅ Keep file sizes reasonable for optimal loading (Profile.JPG could be optimized to under 500KB)
- ✅ Ensure images are high resolution for retina displays
- ✅ Include alt text for accessibility in the HTML

## Image Optimization Notes:
- The Profile.JPG file is quite large (2.8MB) and could be optimized for web use
- Consider resizing to max 400x400 pixels and compressing to reduce file size
- SFSU.jpg is already well-optimized at 52KB

## Status:
✅ **All required images are now present and linked in the HTML**
- Profile photo: Displays in the About section
- SFSU logo: Displays in the Education section

Both images are now properly referenced in `index.html` and will display when you open the portfolio.
