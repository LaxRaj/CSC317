# Final Project Submission - CSC317
**Student:** Lakshyaraj Bhati  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Project:** Recipe Sharing Platform Integration into Portfolio

## Group Project Reflection

### Project Overview
The Recipe Sharing Platform was a collaborative full-stack web application developed as Assignment 5. Our team of four students created a comprehensive platform where users can create, share, and discover recipes with detailed nutritional and cost information.

**Live Application:** https://csc317-group-k.onrender.com  
**Repository:** https://github.com/ianaqui/CSC317Project

### My Role and Contributions
As the **Backend API and Authentication Developer**, I was responsible for:

#### Core Backend Development
- **RESTful API Design:** Created comprehensive API endpoints for all recipe operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Authentication System:** Implemented secure user registration and login using bcrypt for password hashing and express-session for session management
- **Database Integration:** Built the connection layer between our Express.js application and MongoDB using Mongoose
- **Server-Side Validation:** Developed robust input validation and error handling middleware to ensure data integrity
- **Authorization Logic:** Created middleware to protect routes and ensure users can only modify their own recipes

#### Advanced Features Implemented
- **Recipe Filtering API:** Developed backend logic for complex filtering by cost range, preparation time, dietary restrictions, and meal type
- **External API Integration:** Integrated TheMealDB API alongside our user-generated content to provide a comprehensive recipe database
- **Error Handling:** Implemented comprehensive error handling and response management for all API endpoints
- **Database Schema Design:** Collaborated with Adrian (Database Developer) to design efficient MongoDB schemas for recipe-user relationships

### Technical Skills Gained

#### Backend Development
- **Express.js Mastery:** Gained deep understanding of middleware, routing, and server architecture
- **Database Design:** Learned to design efficient MongoDB schemas and implement complex queries
- **API Security:** Understood authentication, authorization, and secure session management
- **Error Handling:** Developed skills in comprehensive error handling and API response management

#### Collaborative Development
- **Git Workflow:** Practiced advanced Git workflows with multiple contributors, including branch management and merge conflict resolution
- **API Documentation:** Learned to document APIs for frontend team integration
- **Code Review:** Participated in peer code reviews to maintain code quality and consistency

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: User Authentication Security
**Problem:** Implementing secure user authentication without compromising user experience  
**Solution:** Used bcrypt for password hashing and express-session for secure session management. Implemented proper logout functionality and session expiration.

#### Challenge 2: API Integration Complexity
**Problem:** Balancing external API data (TheMealDB) with user-generated content  
**Solution:** Created a unified interface that seamlessly presents both data sources while maintaining different route structures for different data types.

#### Challenge 3: Team Coordination
**Problem:** Coordinating backend development with frontend requirements across four team members  
**Solution:** Established clear API contracts early, used consistent naming conventions, and maintained regular communication through team meetings and GitHub issues.

### Learning Outcomes

#### Technical Growth
- **Full-Stack Understanding:** Gained comprehensive understanding of how frontend and backend systems integrate
- **Database Proficiency:** Developed strong skills in MongoDB and Mongoose for data modeling and queries
- **Security Awareness:** Learned importance of input validation, authentication, and authorization in web applications
- **API Design:** Understood principles of RESTful API design and best practices

#### Soft Skills Development
- **Team Communication:** Improved ability to communicate technical requirements and solutions across team members
- **Project Management:** Learned to break down complex features into manageable tasks and coordinate timelines
- **Problem Solving:** Developed systematic approach to debugging and troubleshooting complex backend issues

### Integration into Portfolio
